# LDPC Encoder and Decoder Simulator (5G NR Standard-Based)

This project implements a 5G NR-compatible LDPC (Low-Density Parity Check) encoder and decoder in MATLAB, supporting **both hard-decision and soft-decision decoding**. It simulates error performance over an **AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise)** channel across multiple coderates and provides detailed performance plots.

## 🔢 How It Works

### 1. **Base Matrix and Lifting**
Base matrices (either `NR_2_6_52` or `NR_1_5_352`) are used to construct the full parity-check matrix `H` through **lifting** by factor `z`.

```matlab
[B, H, z] = nrldpc_Hmatrix('NR_2_6_52');
```

### 2. **Encoding**
The encoder (`nr5g_encoder.m`) uses matrix multiplication with shifted identity matrices to compute parity bits.

```matlab
encoded_msg = nr5g_encoder(B, z, input_msg);
```

### 3. **Modulation & Channel**
LDPC-encoded bits are modulated using BPSK and passed through an AWGN channel.

### 4. **Decoding**
- **Hard Decision Decoding**:
  Uses majority logic and bit-flipping approach based on received bits.

- **Soft Decision Decoding**:
  Uses Min-Sum algorithm where messages are exchanged as reliability values (LLR-based).

## 📚 Functions Explained

### `nr5g_encoder(B, z, msg)`
Encodes the input message using shifted identity matrices derived from the base graph `B`.

### `mul_sh(x, k)`
Shifts input vector `x` cyclically by `k` positions.

### `nrldpc_Hmatrix(BG)`

## 📝 Notes

- If `bit_error == 0`, it is replaced with a very small number (`1e-305`) to allow log-scale plotting.
- Ensure base matrices are correctly named and formatted in `.txt` files.
